The purpose of this project is create and computer vision based application that allows for two human players to play chess on their physical boards across internet. Computer vision is used to detect the board and the pieces from picture data send from a smart phone acting as an stationary detector. External Web-application is used as an secondary interface showing the player the state of the game in form of a digitized board, telling them the previous move and allowing player to control the game, like changing their turn after making a move.

All games and and individual moves will be saved to a database for viewing and analyzing later, as well as granting a base for building a service that gives player statistical data based on their individual performance as well as offering coaching, tips or even excercises on how to improve their chess.

The application could additionally offer services for playing not only against human players using the same application, but could also offer funcionality to play against other players and computers using various chess engines online.
