The purpose of this project is to create an application based on machine vision, so that two human players can play chess on their own physical boards even when they aren't in the same place. This will require a machine vision solution where the chessboard, the pieces and the moves are recognized from a video feed. The game will advance when the detected move is transferred over internet to another player who then makes that physical move on his own board. The games will be saved to a database, making it possible to view and analyze them later. OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) can be used for machine vision.

An additional feature could be a chess game that can be played on physical board against a computer. Also there could be a computer based analysis on played games, or a virtual coach that could for example give a hint to the human player on which moves were not very good.
