# Temporary Solutions and Functionality

### Board Recognizion
At the moment the image taken with the phone and sent to server is cropped by the user to match the board, so it can be processed easier by the server, just splitting it to 64 smaller images for each square on the board by using dimensions of the original image.
In future a proper computer vision functionality could be implemented, either using it to improve the accuracy of splitting the images, or even replacing the cropping completely and recognizing the board automatically for the player.
