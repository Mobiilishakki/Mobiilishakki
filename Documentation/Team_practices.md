## Team Practices


### Branching:

New features are developed in their own branches, then merged first to “final test”-branch, and from there to master if it works.
Master should always be production-ready.
Merges are done using pull request, and other team member(s) need to check and accept the merge.


### Definition of Done:
 * Fulfils the requirement of the user story
 * Contains test for the new features
 * And passes all the tests, travis checks
