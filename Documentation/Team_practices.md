## Team Practices


### Branching:

New features are developed in their own branches, then merged first to “travis”-branch, and from there to master if it works.
Code in Master should always be production-ready.
Merges are done using pull request, and other team member(s) need to check and accept the merge.

### Informing other members:
Team members should inform other members if they can't attend to agreed appointments or if they will be late from the meetings.


### Definition of Done:
 * Fulfils the requirement of the user story
 * Works verifiably as intended
